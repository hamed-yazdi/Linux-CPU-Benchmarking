To develop a multithreaded program to test and compare a subset of the Linux scheduling policies available, we follow these steps:

<ul>
  <li>Choose the scheduling policies: <b>SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH, SCHED_IDLE, SCHED_FIFO, and SCHED_RR</b>.</li>
  <li>Write a program that creates multiple threads and assigns each thread to a different scheduling policy. We use the <b>"pthread_create"</b> function to create the threads and the <b>"pthread_setschedparam"</b> function to set the scheduling policy for each thread.
</li>
  <li>Write code to measure the throughput and latency of each thread. We use the clock_gettime function to measure the time taken for each thread to complete its work.
</li>
</ul>
